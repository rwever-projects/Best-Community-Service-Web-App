The objective of this project is to design and build a prototype for an interactive Web application for a community service named “Best Community Service”, provided by a non-profit organization.

This organization aims at benefiting a small community by providing various kinds of services to the local community. The non-profit will charge small fees for some services to cover its costs. Other services will be offered free of charge. Additionally, the non-profit organization will rely on volunteers to provide some of the services offered to the community. It will also rely on a number of paid employees (full time and part time employees) to take care of managing the business and running the services, as well as the operational costs and other activities. The main sources of income for running the business will be donations from known and anonymous donors as well as from small fees charged for some the offered services. The organization will run from a local building, which offers large spaces for organizing social events like weddings, community meetings, and funerals. It will also offer rental service for equipment needed for the events, as well as catering services. Other in-house services include Spanish, arts and crafts, and painting classes given by volunteers. External services are also offered in terms of home care for the elderly and handicapped as well as shuttle services.
